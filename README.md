# Machine Learning: Classifier Decision Boundary
This code plots the decision boundaries of the machine learning algorithms 
 * K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for k=[1,3,5,10]
 * Support Vector Machine (SVM) for kernels=[linear,polynomial,radial,sigmoid]
 * Naive Bayes
 * Tree-based:
   * C.50, CART and Random Forest
   
 These classifiers are applied to a collection of artificial datasets (machine learning benchmark problems).
