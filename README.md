# classifier_decision_boundary
This code plots the decision boundaries of the machine learning algorithms K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for k=[1,3,5,10], Support Vector Machine (SVM) for kernels=[linear,polynomial,radial,sigmoid], Naive Bayes, and the tree-based C.50, CART and Random Forest. These classifiers are applied to a collection of artificial datasets (machine learning benchmark problems).
